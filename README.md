# CV Application Project

This is my rendition of The Odin Project's CV application Project. Visit [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-cv-application) website to read the full set of instructions and requirements for this project. The Cv Application project is the first assignemt that requires the use of React. The main goal here was to use the React library to create a cv builder.
